# Purpose and usage

This XSLT is a proof of concept for the HTML representation of metadata based on [DCAT-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/63567/), and related extensions (as [GeoDCAT-AP](https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/node/139283/)), available on Joinup, the collaboration platform of the [EU ISA Programme](http://ec.europa.eu/isa).
  
As such, this XSLT must be considered as unstable, and can be updated any time based on the revisions to the DCAT-AP specifications and related extensions.

Comments and inquiries should be sent to the GeoDCAT-AP WG mailing list: <dcat_application_profile-geo@joinup.ec.europa.eu>
